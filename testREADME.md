## 🎯 Project Goal

Can we predict 30-day hospital readmission risk from routine clinical measurements
(lab values, vitals, diagnoses) collected at the time of discharge?

We hypothesize that a combination of discharge lab values and comorbidity count is
predictive of readmission, and that logistic regression can identify the most influential
clinical features.

## 📊 Dataset

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999–2008) |
| **Source** | UCI Machine Learning Repository |
| **URL** | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 |
| **Size** | ~100,000 patient encounters, 50 features |
| **Citation** | Strack, B. et al. (2014). Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates. *BioMed Research International*, 2014. |

The dataset contains inpatient encounter records including demographics, diagnoses,
lab results, medications, and a binary readmission outcome (`<30 days` vs. `NO`).

## 📝 Summary of Findings

Our EDA revealed that readmission rates differ substantially across age groups, with
patients aged 70–80 showing the highest 30-day readmission rate (~14%). A chi-square
test confirmed a statistically significant association between primary diagnosis category
and readmission status (p < 0.001), and bootstrap confidence intervals placed the
overall readmission rate at 11.2% ± 0.4%.

The logistic regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.79, outperforming the
decision tree (0.74). The three strongest predictors of readmission were number of
inpatient visits in the prior year, number of diagnoses recorded at discharge, and
HbA1c result. These findings suggest that care-transition planning — particularly for
high-comorbidity patients with prior hospitalizations — may be the highest-yield
intervention target. Limitations include the dataset's age (1999–2008) and the
exclusion of social determinants of health, which likely confound readmission risk.
